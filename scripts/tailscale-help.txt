Tailscale quick steps

1) Install:
   winget install --id Tailscale.Tailscale -e

2) Login/enable:
   tailscale up

3) Get this PC's Tailscale IP:
   tailscale ip -4

4) From your phone/laptop (logged into the same Tailscale account), open:
   http://<tailscale-ip>:3000/

Notes:
- This is private access (not public internet), so VPN/filters usually don't block it.
- You may still need Windows Firewall rule allowing inbound TCP 3000 on Private profile.
